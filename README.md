## FAQ
<ul>
  <li>Where is WebDev1? Abandoned in my projects folder.</li>
  <li>What is OneClick Install? It is a way of publishing programs with visual studios made by microsoft that only needs one click to install. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t71a733d(v=vs.140).aspx">Read On</a>.</li>
  <li>What does Full Edit do? It is a way of editting that shows you the whole file.</li>
  <li>What does Section Edit do? It is a way of editting that shows you the file in section, it will show you the CSS, HTML and JS in diffrent tabs like CodePen. This still needs to be made.</li>
  <li>What does Build do? It is a very bad website builder for building the webpage. This still needs to be made.</li>
  <li>Why does Drag 'n' Drop box not work? I'm working on this part.</li>
  <li>How did you make this? A lot of time of crawling the web and talking to rubber ducks.</li>
</ul>
